Code is still being developed, this is verison 0.1
This is NO trading bot. I build this code to help me see indicators fast via Telegram to help me make better decisions.
Also to give me alerts when certain levels are being crossed. 
For the future I want to build in more alerts and use some machine learning to make it better.

The main.py can be used and has to put in the same folder as the config.ini, you do have to add the api key from cryptocompare(free) and telegram(just create free bot). After that insert your user id and you can run it.
